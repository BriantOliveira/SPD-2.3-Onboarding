# SPD 2.3 Onboarding

# Title

## Course Description

This course prepares students to onboard to a development job and to navigate the time between joining a company and making valuable contributions to the codebase; commonly known as ramping. Building on best practices from company onboarding programs or Ramp Camps, the course covers common architectures and tools that large codebases use to operate including continuous integration with Travis CI, code reviews, server admin, and containers using Docker. 

The course also covers topics one must master to have a successful life as a working professional:  personal finance and health and wellness. Students build their own personal financial model to inform their decisions reguarding their spending and savings. Students also gain an understanding of insurance, credit, taxation, compound interest, infliaction as well as other key concepts in personal finance.

Additionally, the course covers science-backed practices to improve one's health and wellness. We devote a few class sessions to exposing students to best practices.

## Class Assignments

- List (with links) of all course-level assignments (i.e. tutorials, challenge sets, contractor project, custom projects, etc)
- Under each assignment link the rubric used to evaluate it or describe how it is evaluated.
- Projects should be linked to a project page which has a description & requirements.

### Tutorials
Tutorials are to help you get started in a topic.  They are graded on completion only.

- - Personal Finance Tutorial - step by step instructions to building a personal financial model. This tutorial also familiarizes you with the basics of using spreadsheets (e.g. Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, Apple Numbers)

### Projects
Projects are a chance for you to build and ship code that is based on class concepts.  Many are open ended allowing you to be creative and to have individual work for your portfolio.
- [Sample Project](Sample_Project.md)
    -   [Sample Project Rubric](Sample_Rubric.md)

## Evaluation
[MAKE SPECIFIC TO YOUR COURSE SO IT IS SUPER CLEAR]
To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:

- Complete all required tutorials 
- Pass all projects according to the associated project rubric
- Pass the final summative assessment >=75%
- Actively participate in class and abide by the attendance policy
- Make up all classwork from all absences

## Attendance
Just like any job, attendance at Make School is required and a key component of your success. Attendance is being onsite from 9:30 to 5:30 each day, attending all scheduled sessions including classes, huddles, coaching and school meetings, and working in the study labs when not in a scheduled session. Working onsite allows you to learn with your peers, have access to support from TAs, instructors and others, and is vital to your learning.

Attendance requirements for scheduled sessions are:
- No more than two no call no shows per term in any scheduled session.
- No more than four excused absences per term in any scheduled session.

Failure to meet these requirements will result in a PIP (Participation Improvement Plan).  Failure to improve after the PIP is cause for not being allowed to continue at Make School.
