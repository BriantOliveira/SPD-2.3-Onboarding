# SPD 2.3 Onboarding

## Course Description

This course prepares students to onboard to a development job and to navigate the time between joining a company and making valuable contributions to the codebase; commonly known as ramping. Building on best practices from company onboarding programs or Ramp Camps, the course covers common architectures and tools that large codebases use to operate including continuous integration with Travis CI, code reviews, server admin, and containers using Docker. 

The course also covers topics one must master to have a successful life as a working professional:  personal finance and health and wellness. Students build their own personal financial model to inform their decisions reguarding their spending and savings. Students also gain an understanding of insurance, credit, taxation, compound interest, infliaction as well as other key concepts in personal finance.

Additionally, the course covers science-backed practices to improve one's health and wellness. We devote a few class sessions to exposing students to best practices.

## Attendance
Just like any job, attendance at Make School is required and a key component of your success. Attendance is being onsite from 9:30 to 5:30 each day, attending all scheduled sessions including classes, huddles, coaching and school meetings, and working in the study labs when not in a scheduled session. Working onsite allows you to learn with your peers, have access to support from TAs, instructors and others, and is vital to your learning.

Attendance requirements for scheduled sessions are:
- No more than two no call no shows per term in any scheduled session.
- No more than four excused absences per term in any scheduled session.

Failure to meet these requirements will result in a PIP (Participation Improvement Plan).  Failure to improve after the PIP is cause for not being allowed to continue at Make School.
